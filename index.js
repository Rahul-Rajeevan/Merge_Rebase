// Data Encapsulation: As shown, you can create “private” variables. For instance, 
// a module pattern or factory function can use closures to store internal state and 
// expose only certain functions. e.g., a function createUser(name) that internally stores name 
// and returns methods like getName() or setName() – those methods form closures over the name variable, 
// keeping it hidden from the outside except through those methods.
